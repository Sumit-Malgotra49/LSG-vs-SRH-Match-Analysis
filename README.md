🏏 EDA on LSG vs SRH Match – What Went Wrong for SRH?
This project dives into an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the LSG vs SRH match to uncover what exactly went wrong for Sunrisers Hyderabad that led to their defeat. Using match data and smart breakdowns, I’ve dissected their performance across different phases and innings to identify key turning points.

📊 Objective
The goal of this analysis is to break down the match and highlight SRH’s shortcomings, especially in their bowling performance, across multiple phases of the game.

🔍 Analysis Workflow
1. Match Phase Segmentation
The match was divided into three key phases (Powerplay, Middle Overs, Death Overs).

Analyzed SRH’s bowling performance in each phase against LSG.

Compared run flow, wickets taken, economy rates, and pressure-building factors.

2. Innings-Wise Breakdown
Separated the dataset into two innings:

LSG’s innings – focused on how SRH bowled, where they lost control.

SRH’s innings – analyzed their batting strategy and where it fell short.

Looked at strike rates, dot ball percentages, boundary frequencies, and partnerships.

📌 Key Insights (Sneak Peek)
Ineffective bowling during crucial middle overs allowed LSG to accelerate.

Death over execution lacked discipline—too many freebies.

SRH's top order crumbled under pressure, leading to poor momentum.
